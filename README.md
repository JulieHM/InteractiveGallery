## Contents
This is the repository for deliverable 2 in the subject IT2810 for group 36. We have made an interactive gallery, which lets the user choose between a number of combinations of music, image and poetry. Exlpore the gallery by pressing the different buttons, and view more images by scrolling forwards and backwards.  

Further documentation can be found in `p2/README.md`

## How to run the app
To run the app, write `npm start` in your terminal while in the p2 folder.
