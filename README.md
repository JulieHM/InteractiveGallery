## Contents
This is the repository for deliverable 2 in the subject IT2810 for group 36. We have made an interactive gallery, which lets the user choose between a number of combinations of music, image and poetry. Exlpore the gallery by pressing the different buttons, and view more images by scrolling forwards and backwards. 

## How to run the app
To run the app, write `npm start` in your terminal while in the p2 folder.

To run the tests, write `npm run test` from the same folder.
